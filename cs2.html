    <h1>Counter-Strike 2</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Counter-Strike 2 </strong>is the largest technical leap forward in Counter-Strike’s history,ensuring
        new features and updates for years to come. All of the game’s new features will be revealed when it
        officially launches this summer, but the road to <strong>Counter-Strike 2 </strong> begins today as a
        Limited Test for select CS:GO players. During this testing period, we’ll be evaluating a subset of features to
        shake out any issues before the worldwide release.
